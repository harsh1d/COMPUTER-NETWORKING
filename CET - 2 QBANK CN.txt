Hereâ€™s a detailed solution for each question from the question bank for CN CET - 2:

---

### 1. Functions of Data Link Layer
- **Framing**: The Data Link Layer encapsulates network layer packets into frames. It adds headers and trailers to the packets to create frames, which helps in identifying the start and end of the data.
  
- **Physical Addressing**: Each frame contains a source and destination MAC (Media Access Control) address, which is used to identify devices on the same local network.

- **Error Detection and Correction**: The Data Link Layer implements mechanisms to detect and correct errors that may occur during transmission. Common methods include checksums, CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), and parity bits.

- **Flow Control**: This function manages the rate of data transmission between sender and receiver to prevent overwhelming the receiver. Techniques include Stop-and-Wait and Sliding Window protocols.

- **Access Control**: The Data Link Layer determines how multiple devices on the same network segment share the communication medium. Protocols like CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) are used in Ethernet networks.

---

### 2. Types of Framing Methods
- **Character Count**: The frame begins with a field that specifies the number of characters in the frame. This method is simple but can lead to issues if the count is corrupted.

- **Byte Stuffing**: Special characters (like the escape character) are used to indicate the start and end of frames. If the data contains the special character, it is "stuffed" with an additional character to avoid confusion.

- **Bit Stuffing**: Similar to byte stuffing, but it involves inserting a '0' after a sequence of five consecutive '1's in the data to prevent confusion with frame delimiters.

---

### 3. Error Detecting and Correcting Methods
- **Parity Check**: A simple method where a parity bit is added to the data. If the number of 1s is odd, the parity bit is set to 1 (odd parity), and if even, it is set to 0 (even parity). This method can only detect single-bit errors.

- **Checksums**: The sender calculates a checksum by summing the data segments and sending it along with the data. The receiver performs the same calculation and compares the result to the received checksum.

- **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**: A more robust method that treats data as a polynomial and divides it by a predetermined polynomial. The remainder is appended to the data. The receiver performs the same division to check for errors.

- **Hamming Code**: Adds redundancy bits to the data to allow for error detection and correction. It can detect up to two-bit errors and correct one-bit errors by using specific parity checks.

---

### 4. CRC Method with Example
- **Explanation**: CRC is a method used to detect errors in digital data. It uses polynomial division to generate a fixed-size checksum.

- **Example**:
  - Data: `1101`
  - Polynomial (Divisor): `1011`
  - Steps:
    1. Append zeros to the data equal to the degree of the polynomial: `1101000`.
    2. Perform binary division of `1101000` by `1011`.
    3. The remainder is the CRC checksum. If the remainder is `011`, the transmitted data becomes `1101011`.
    4. The receiver performs the same division. If the remainder is `000`, the data is considered error-free.

  - **Source Port**: 16 bits
  - **Destination Port**: 16 bits
  - **Sequence Number**: 32 bits
  - **Acknowledgment Number**: 32 bits
  - **Data Offset**: 4 bits
  - **Flags**: 9 bits (URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN)
  - **Window Size**: 16 bits
  - **Checksum**: 16 bits
  - **Urgent Pointer**: 16 bits
  - **Options**: Variable length

  +-------------------+-------------------+
  | Sequence Number    | Acknowledgment Number |
  +-------------------+-------------------+
  | Data Offset | Flags | Window Size     |
  +-------------------+-------------------+
  | Checksum          | Urgent Pointer    |
  +-------------------+-------------------+
  | Options (if any)  | Data              |
  +-------------------+-------------------+
  ```

### 6. Pure Aloha and Delay Percentage
- **Definition**: Pure Aloha is a simple communication protocol that allows users to transmit data whenever they have it, without waiting for a specific time slot. This can lead to collisions when two or more users transmit simultaneously.

- **Delay Percentage**: The maximum channel utilization for Pure Aloha is calculated as:
  - Utilization (U) = G * e^(-2G)
  - The maximum utilization occurs at G = 0.5, yielding U = 0.184 or 18.4%. This means that only about 18.4% of the time is effectively used for successful transmissions, while the rest is wasted due to collisions.

---

### 7. Principles of Reliable Data Transfer
- **Acknowledgments**: The sender requires an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver for each packet sent. If an ACK is not received within a certain timeframe, the sender assumes the packet was lost and retransmits it.

- **Retransmission**: Lost or corrupted packets are retransmitted based on the acknowledgment mechanism. This ensures that all data is eventually received correctly.

- **Sequence Numbers**: Each packet is assigned a unique sequence number, allowing the receiver to detect duplicates and reorder packets that arrive out of sequence.

- **Timeouts**: The sender sets a timer for each packet sent. If the timer expires before an ACK is received, the sender retransmits the packet.

---

### 8. Flow Control and Methods
- **Definition**: Flow control is a technique used to manage the rate of data transmission between sender and receiver to prevent overwhelming the receiver.

- **Methods**:
  - **Stop-and-Wait**: The sender transmits one frame and waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next frame. This method is simple but can be inefficient, especially over long distances.
  
  - **Sliding Window**: This method allows the sender to send multiple frames before needing an acknowledgment. The sender maintains a window of frames that can be sent without waiting for an ACK, improving efficiency.

---

### 9. Sliding Window Protocol
- **Explanation**: The Sliding Window Protocol allows a sender to transmit multiple frames before needing an acknowledgment for the first one. The window size determines how many frames can be sent without waiting for an acknowledgment. As the sender receives ACKs, the window slides forward, allowing new frames to be sent.

- **Advantages**: This method increases the utilization of the network and reduces the waiting time for acknowledgments, making it more efficient than Stop-and-Wait.

---

### 10. Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat Protocols
- **Go-Back-N**: In this protocol, the sender can send several frames (up to a specified window size) before needing an acknowledgment. If a frame is lost or an error is detected, the sender must go back and retransmit that frame and all subsequent frames, which can lead to inefficiencies.

- **Selective Repeat**: Unlike Go-Back-N, Selective Repeat only retransmits the specific frames that were lost or corrupted. This method is more efficient as it reduces the number of retransmissions, allowing for better utilization of the network.

---

### 11. Channel Utilization in ALOHA
- **Proof**: 
  - For Pure ALOHA, the channel utilization is given by the formula:
    - U = G * e^(-2G)
    - The maximum utilization occurs at G = 0.5, resulting in U = 0.184 or 18.4%.
  
  - For Slotted ALOHA, the formula is:
    - U = G * e^(-G)
    - The maximum utilization occurs at G = 1, yielding U = 0.368 or 36.8%. This shows that Slotted ALOHA is more efficient than Pure ALOHA.

---

### 12. STOP and WAIT Protocols
- **Explanation**: The Stop-and-Wait protocol is a simple flow control method where the sender transmits one frame and then stops to wait for an acknowledgment from the receiver before sending the next frame. This ensures that the receiver can process each frame without being overwhelmed.

- **Disadvantages**: While simple, this method can lead to inefficiencies, especially in high-latency networks, as the sender remains idle while waiting for an ACK.

---

### 13. Multiplexing in Transport Layer
- **Definition**: Multiplexing in the transport layer refers to the process of combining multiple data streams from different applications into a single stream for transmission over the network.

- **Function**: This allows multiple applications to share the same network connection, optimizing bandwidth usage. The transport layer uses port numbers to distinguish between different applications and ensure that data is delivered to the correct destination.

---

### 14. Selective Repeat Protocols
- **Explanation**: The Selective Repeat protocol allows the sender to transmit multiple frames and only retransmit those that are lost or corrupted. The receiver maintains a buffer to store out-of-order frames until the missing frames are received.

- **Advantages**: This method improves efficiency by reducing the number of retransmissions compared to Go-Back-N, as only specific frames are resent rather than all subsequent frames.

---

### 15. Router Architecture and Components
- **Input Ports**: These ports receive incoming packets from the network. They perform functions such as checking the packet's header and determining the appropriate output port.

- **Switching Fabric**: This is the internal mechanism that transfers packets from input ports to output ports. It can be implemented using various technologies, such as crossbar switches or shared memory.

- **Output Ports**: These ports send packets to the next hop in the network. They may also perform queuing and scheduling to manage outgoing traffic.

- **Routing Processor**: This component makes routing decisions based on the routing table and the current network topology. It updates the routing table and manages the overall operation of the router.

---

### 16. CRC Method with Example (Repeated)
- **Explanation**: CRC is a method used to detect errors in digital data. It uses polynomial division to generate a fixed-size checksum.

- **Example**:
  - Data: `1101`
  - Polynomial (Divisor): `1011`
  - Steps:
    1. Append zeros to the data equal to the degree of the polynomial: `1101000`.
    2. Perform binary division of `1101000` by `1011`.
    3. The remainder is the CRC checksum. If the remainder is `011`, the transmitted data becomes `1101011`.
    4. The receiver performs the same division. If the remainder is `000`, the data is considered error-free.

---

### 17. Routing and Routing Algorithms
- **Definition**: Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network traffic. It involves determining the best route for data packets to travel from source to destination.

- **Algorithms**:
  - **Distance Vector**: Each router maintains a table of distances to all other routers and shares this information with its neighbors. It updates its table based on the information received.
  
  - **Link State**: Each router has a complete view of the network topology and shares its state with all other routers. This allows for more efficient routing decisions.

  - **Path Vector**: Used in BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), it maintains the path information that gets updated as the route changes.

  - **Flooding**: Sends packets to all nodes in the network, ensuring delivery but potentially causing congestion.

---

### 18. Network Service Model
- **Definition**: The network service model describes how data is transmitted over a network, including aspects such as reliability, ordering, and whether the service is connection-oriented or connectionless.

- **Types**:
  - **Connection-Oriented**: Establishes a connection before data transfer (e.g., TCP).
  - **Connectionless**: Sends data without establishing a connection (e.g., UDP).

---

### 19. Shortest Path Routing Algorithm
- **Explanation**: Shortest path routing algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, find the shortest path from a source node to a destination node in a network. They evaluate the cost of each path based on metrics like distance or latency.

- **Process**:
  1. Initialize distances from the source to all nodes as infinite, except for the source node itself, which is set to zero.
  2. Use a priority queue to explore the node with the smallest distance.
  3. Update the distances to neighboring nodes based on the current node's distance.
  4. Repeat until all nodes have been processed.

---

### 20. Services Provided by the Network Layer
- **Routing**: Determines the best path for data packets to travel through the network.

- **Logical Addressing**: Assigns unique IP addresses to devices, allowing them to be identified on the network.

- **Packet Forwarding**: Moves packets from the source to the destination based on the routing decisions made.

- **Fragmentation and Reassembly**: Breaks down packets into smaller units for transmission and reassembles them at the destination to ensure data integrity.

---

### 21. Congestion and Principles of Congestion Control
- **Definition**: Congestion occurs when the network is overloaded with data, leading to packet loss and delays.

- **Principles**:
  - **Traffic Shaping**: Controls the amount of data entering the network to prevent congestion.
  - **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic evenly across the network to avoid bottlenecks.
  - **Resource Reservation**: Allocates bandwidth for specific applications to ensure they have the necessary resources.

---

### 22. Open Loop and Closed Loop Solutions for Congestion
- **Open Loop**: These solutions implement predefined strategies to manage traffic without feedback from the network. Examples include traffic shaping and admission control.

- **Closed Loop**: These solutions adjust traffic based on current network conditions. They use feedback mechanisms to monitor congestion levels and adapt accordingly, such as adjusting the rate of data transmission or rerouting traffic.

---

### 23. Traffic Shaping for Congestion Control
- **Explanation**: Traffic shaping is a technique used to control the flow of data into a network. It smooths out bursts of traffic by regulating the amount of data that can be sent over a given period.

- **Methods**:
  - **Token Bucket**: Allows bursts of traffic by accumulating tokens over time, where each token represents permission to send a certain amount of data.
  - **Leaky Bucket**: Sends data at a constant rate, where excess data is stored in a "bucket" and sent out at a steady rate, preventing sudden spikes in traffic.

---

### 24. The Leaky Bucket Algorithm
- **Explanation**: The Leaky Bucket algorithm is a traffic shaping mechanism that controls the rate of data transmission. It allows data to flow at a constant rate, regardless of the incoming burstiness.

- **How it Works**:
  - A "bucket" holds incoming data packets. If the bucket overflows (i.e., incoming data exceeds the bucket's capacity), the excess packets are discarded.
  - The algorithm "leaks" data at a steady rate, ensuring that the output rate remains constant and preventing congestion.

---

### 25. The Token Bucket Algorithm
- **Explanation**: The Token Bucket algorithm allows for flexible traffic shaping by permitting bursts of data transmission while maintaining an average rate.

- **How it Works**:
  - Tokens are generated at a fixed rate and added to a bucket. Each token allows the transmission of a certain amount of data.
  - If the bucket is full, additional tokens are discarded. When data needs to be sent, the sender must have enough tokens in the bucket to proceed. This allows for bursts of traffic when tokens are available.

---

### 26. Congestion Control in Virtual Circuits
- **Explanation**: In virtual circuit networks, congestion control is managed by reserving bandwidth for each connection, ensuring that data flows smoothly along established paths.

- **Techniques**:
  - **Resource Reservation Protocols**: Allocate bandwidth for specific connections to prevent congestion.
  - **Traffic Management**: Monitor and adjust the flow of data to maintain optimal performance and prevent overload.

---

### 27. Responsibilities of Transport Layer

- **Packet Forwarding**: Moves packets from the source to the destination based on routing decisions, ensuring that data reaches its intended recipient.

- **Fragmentation and Reassembly**: Breaks down packets into smaller units for transmission and reassembles them at the destination to ensure data integrity.

---

### 29. Short Note on IPV4 and IPV6 Addressing
- **IPV4 Addressing**: 
  - Uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
  - Address format: `A.B.C.D` where A, B, C, and D are decimal numbers ranging from 0 to 255.

- **IPV6 Addressing**: 
  - Uses 128-bit addresses, providing a vastly larger address space to accommodate the growing number of devices.
  - Address format: Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).

---

### 30. Types of Classful Addressing and Functions

### 31. Flow Control and Methods (Repeated)
- **Definition**: Flow control is a technique used to manage the rate of data transmission between sender and receiver to prevent overwhelming the receiver.

- **Methods**:
  - **Stop-and-Wait**: The sender transmits one frame and waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next frame. This method is simple but can be inefficient, especially over long distances.
  
  - **Sliding Window**: This method allows the sender to send multiple frames before needing an acknowledgment. The sender maintains a window of frames that can be sent without waiting for an ACK, improving efficiency.

---

### 32. Comparison between Datagram and Virtual Circuit
- **Datagram**: 
  - Connectionless protocol where each packet (datagram) is treated independently. 
  - No prior setup is required, and packets may take different paths to reach the destination, leading to potential out-of-order delivery.

- **Virtual Circuit**: 
  - Connection-oriented protocol that establishes a path before data transmission. 
  - All packets follow the same path, ensuring in-order delivery and reliability, but requires setup and teardown phases.

---

### 33. TCP Slow Start Approach
- **Explanation**: The TCP Slow Start algorithm is a congestion control mechanism that begins with a small congestion window (CWND) and increases it exponentially with each acknowledgment received.

- **Process**:
  1. Starts with a CWND of 1 MSS (Maximum Segment Size).
  2. For each ACK received, the CWND increases by 1 MSS.
  3. This exponential growth continues until a threshold (ssthresh) is reached, after which it switches to linear growth.

- **Purpose**: This approach helps to quickly utilize available bandwidth while avoiding congestion.

---

### 34. Adaptive vs. Non-Adaptive Routing Algorithms
- **Adaptive Routing**: 
  - Adjusts routes based on current network conditions, such as traffic load and link failures.
  - Examples include algorithms that use real-time metrics to determine the best path.

- **Non-Adaptive Routing**: 
  - Uses fixed routes regardless of network state. 
  - Routes are determined based on static information and do not change in response to network conditions.

---

### 35. Shortest Path Routing Algorithm (Repeated)
- **Explanation**: Shortest path routing algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, find the shortest path from a source node to a destination node in a network. They evaluate the cost of each path based on metrics like distance or latency.

- **Process**:
  1. Initialize distances from the source to all nodes as infinite, except for the source node itself, which is set to zero.
  2. Use a priority queue to explore the node with the smallest distance.
  3. Update the distances to neighboring nodes based on the current node's distance.
  4. Repeat until all nodes have been processed.

---

### 36. Services Provided by the Network Layer (Repeated)

- **Fragmentation and Reassembly**: Breaks down packets into smaller units for transmission and reassembles them at the destination to ensure data integrity.

---

### 37. Flooding Routing Algorithm
- **Explanation**: Flooding is a simple routing algorithm that sends packets to all nodes in the network. Each node forwards the packet to all its neighbors except the one from which it received the packet.

- **Advantages**: Ensures that packets reach their destination, even in the presence of network failures.

- **Disadvantages**: Can lead to network congestion and excessive duplication of packets, as multiple copies may traverse the same path.

---

### 38. Distance Vector Routing Algorithm
- **Explanation**: In the Distance Vector routing algorithm, each router maintains a table (vector) that contains the distance to every other router in the network. Routers periodically share their tables with their neighbors.

- **Process**:
  1. Each router sends its distance vector to its neighbors.
  2. Upon receiving a vector, a router updates its own table if it finds a shorter path to any destination.
  3. This process continues until all routers have consistent routing tables.

---

### 39. Count-to-Infinity Problem
- **Explanation**: The Count-to-Infinity problem occurs in distance vector routing when a router continuously updates its routing table with incorrect information, leading to an infinite loop of updates.

- **Example**: If a router loses connection to a neighbor, it may incorrectly believe that the distance to that neighbor is still valid, causing it to keep incrementing the distance until it reaches infinity.

---

### 40. Link State Routing Algorithm
- **Explanation**: The Link State routing algorithm allows each router to maintain a complete view of the network topology. Each router shares its state (link costs) with all other routers, enabling them to independently calculate the best paths.

- **Process**:
  1. Each router discovers its neighbors and measures the cost to reach them.
  2. Routers send link state advertisements (LSAs) to all other routers in the network.
  3. Upon receiving LSAs, each router constructs a complete map of the network.
  4. Using algorithms like Dijkstra's, each router calculates the shortest path to every other router.

- **Advantages**: Provides faster convergence and more accurate routing compared to distance vector algorithms.

---

### 41. Hierarchical Routing Algorithm
- **Explanation**: Hierarchical routing divides the network into regions or hierarchies, reducing the complexity of routing by managing routes within smaller groups.

- **Process**:
  1. The network is divided into areas or domains, each managed by a local router.
  2. Routers within the same area share routing information, while inter-area routing is handled by border routers.
  3. This structure reduces the size of routing tables and limits the scope of routing updates.

- **Advantages**: Improves scalability and efficiency, especially in large networks.

---

### 42. Broadcast Routing and Multicast Routing
- **Broadcast Routing**: 
  - Sends packets to all nodes in the network. 
  - Useful for applications where all devices need to receive the same information, such as ARP requests.

- **Multicast Routing**: 
  - Targets a specific group of devices that have expressed interest in receiving certain data. 
  - Optimizes bandwidth by sending packets only to those interested, using protocols like IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol).

- **Advantages**: Reduces network congestion and improves efficiency by minimizing unnecessary data transmission to devices that do not need it.

Answer:
Framing methods are techniques used to define the boundaries of frames in data transmission. The primary types include:

1. ByteOriented (CharacterBased) Framing: Uses specific byte values as frame delimiters, such as flags (e.g., in HDLC).
2. BitOriented Framing: Utilizes a specific bit sequence to mark frame boundaries, allowing for more flexible and efficient framing.
3. FixedLength Framing: Frames are of a predetermined fixed size, simplifying processing but potentially wasting bandwidth.
4. VariableLength Framing: Frames can vary in size, offering flexibility to accommodate different amounts of data.



Question 3:

Description: Discuss various Error detecting and correcting methods.

Answer:
Common error detection and correction methods include:

1. Parity Checks: Adds a parity bit to make the number of 1s either even or odd, detecting singlebit errors.
2. Checksums: Sums the data segments and appends the result, detecting errors through mismatched checksums.
3. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): Uses polynomial division to detect multiplebit errors with high reliability.
4. Hamming Code: Adds redundant bits to enable both error detection and correction of singlebit errors.
5. ReedSolomon Codes: Capable of correcting multiple symbol errors, widely used in digital communications and storage.



Question 4:

Description: Explain CRC method with your own example.

Answer:
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is an errordetecting method that uses polynomial division to generate a checksum for data integrity verification. 

Example:
Consider data bits $1 and a generator polynomial $1. 

1. Append three zeros to the data (degree of generator  1): $1.
2. Perform binary division of $1 by $1.
3. The remainder after division is the CRC, say $1.
4. The transmitted frame becomes $1.
5. At the receiver, dividing $1 by $1 should yield a remainder of $1 if no errors occurred.



Question 5:

Description: Explain the TCP segment with diagram?

Answer:
A TCP segment consists of a header and data. The header includes fields such as Source Port, Destination Port, Sequence Number, Acknowledgment Number, Data Offset, Flags (e.g., SYN, ACK), Window Size, Checksum, and Urgent Pointer. The data section carries the actual payload.






Question 6:

Description: What is pure aloha and what is their delay percentage

Answer:
Pure ALOHA is a simple network protocol where users transmit data whenever they have information to send, without checking if the channel is free. If a collision occurs, the sender waits for a random time before retransmitting. The maximum channel utilization for pure ALOHA is 18%, meaning only 18% of the channel capacity is effectively used due to collisions.



Question 7:

Description: Explain principles of reliable data transfer

Answer:
Reliable data transfer ensures that data is delivered accurately and in order, despite potential issues like errors, losses, or duplications. Key principles include:

1. Acknowledgments: Receivers send acknowledgments to confirm receipt.
2. Retransmissions: Lost or corrupted frames are retransmitted.
3. Sequence Numbers: Frames are numbered to track order and detect duplicates.
4. Flow Control: Regulates data flow to prevent overwhelming the receiver.
5. Error Detection and Correction: Identifies and corrects errors in transmitted data.



Question 8:

Description: What is meant by Flow control? Discuss different flow control methods.

Answer:
Flow control manages the rate of data transmission between sender and receiver to prevent the sender from overwhelming the receiver. Methods include:

1. StopandWait: Sender transmits one frame and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next.
2. Sliding Window: Allows multiple frames to be sent before needing acknowledgments, improving efficiency.
3. CreditBased Flow Control: Allocates credits to the sender based on the receiver's buffer capacity.



Question 9:

Description: Explain sliding window protocol.

Answer:
The sliding window protocol allows multiple frames to be sent before requiring acknowledgments, enhancing throughput. It uses a window that represents the range of sequence numbers that can be sent without acknowledgment. As frames are acknowledged, the window slides forward, permitting the sender to transmit additional frames within the window size. This method efficiently manages data flow and ensures orderly delivery.



Question 10:

Description: Explain Go back â€˜nâ€™ and selective repeat protocols.

Answer:
 GoBackN: Allows multiple frames to be sent without acknowledgment, but if a frame is lost or corrupted, all subsequent frames are retransmitted from the erroneous frame onwards.
 Selective Repeat: Only the specific frame that was lost or corrupted is retransmitted, not affecting the subsequent frames, which increases efficiency by reducing unnecessary retransmissions.



Question 11:

Description: Prove that the channel utilization is 18% in ALOHA and 37% slotted ALOHA.

Answer:
 Pure ALOHA Utilization: Maximum throughput S = G  e^(2G). The maximum occurs at G = 0.5, yielding S = 0.5  e^(1) â‰ˆ 0.184 or 18%.
 Slotted ALOHA Utilization: Maximum throughput S = G  e^(G). The maximum occurs at G = 1, yielding S = 1  e^(1) â‰ˆ 0.368 or 37%.



Question 12:

Description: Explain different STOP and WAIT protocols.

Answer:
StopandWait protocols involve the sender transmitting one frame and waiting for an acknowledgment before sending the next. Variations include:

1. Basic StopandWait: Simple acknowledgment for each frame.
2. GoBackN (with n=1): A variant where the sender can send the next frame only after acknowledgment.
3. Selective Repeat (in context): Though typically associated with sliding window, can be conceptualized in stopping and waiting for selective acknowledgments.



Question 13:

Description: What is multiplexing in transport layer and explain their work function

Answer:
Multiplexing in the transport layer allows multiple applications to share a single network connection by using port numbers. It works by combining data streams from different applications into a single stream for transmission and then demultiplexing them at the receiver's end, directing each data stream to the appropriate application based on port numbers.



Question 14:

Description: Explain selective repeat protocols

Answer:
Selective Repeat is a sliding window protocol where the sender can transmit multiple frames before needing acknowledgments, and only the frames that are lost or corrupted are retransmitted. It maintains individual timers for each frame, allowing the receiver to acknowledge frames out of order and buffer them until missing frames are received, enhancing efficiency and throughput.

Question 19:

Description: Explain the shortest path routing algorithm.

Answer:
The shortest path routing algorithm, such as Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, finds the least cost path from a source node to all other nodes in a network. It iteratively selects the nearest unvisited node, updates the path costs to its neighbors, and marks it as visited until all nodes have been processed, ensuring the shortest path is identified for efficient routing.

Question 21:

Description: What is congestion? Give the general principles of congestion control?

Answer:
Congestion occurs when network demand exceeds capacity, leading to degraded performance and potential packet loss. General principles of congestion control include:

1. Prevention: Avoiding congestion through resource management and traffic shaping.
2. Avoidance: Dynamically adjusting data rates based on network conditions.
3. Recovery: Restoring normal operation after congestion has occurred.
4. Control Mechanisms: Implementing algorithms like TCP congestion control (e.g., slow start, congestion avoidance).



Question 22:

Description: Explain Open loop and Close loop solutions for congestion.

Answer:
 Open Loop Solutions: Prevent congestion by regulating traffic based on preset policies without feedback from the network, such as traffic shaping and admission control.
 Closed Loop Solutions: Respond to congestion based on network feedback, adjusting transmission rates dynamically, as seen in TCP's congestion control mechanisms.



Question 23:

Description: How traffic shaping will be done to control congestion?

Answer:
Traffic shaping controls congestion by regulating the flow of data into the network to match its capacity. Techniques include:

1. Buffering: Temporarily storing excess data to smooth out traffic bursts.
2. Rate Limiting: Setting maximum transmission rates for data flows.
3. Priority Queuing: Assigning priority levels to different types of traffic to ensure critical data is transmitted first.
4. Token Bucket: Allowing data transmission bursts up to a certain limit while enforcing average rate constraints.



Question 24:

Description: Explain The Leaky Bucket algorithm.

Answer:
The Leaky Bucket algorithm controls data flow by allowing a fixed rate of data transmission. Data packets enter a metaphorical bucket at varying rates but are transmitted out at a steady rate. If the incoming rate exceeds the bucket capacity, excess packets are discarded, thereby smoothing out bursts and preventing congestion.



Question 25:

Description: Explain the Token Bucket algorithm.

Answer:
The Token Bucket algorithm manages data transmission by using tokens that represent permission to send bytes. Tokens are generated at a fixed rate and stored in a bucket up to a maximum capacity. To transmit data, a corresponding number of tokens must be available. This allows for bursts of data transmission as long as tokens are available, providing both rate control and burst flexibility.



Question 26:

Description: How the congestion can be controlled in Virtual Circuits

Answer:
In Virtual Circuits, congestion control can be managed by:

1. Resource Reservation: Allocating fixed bandwidth for each virtual circuit to prevent overutilization.

Answer:
(Repeated Question 8.)

Answer:
Flow control ensures that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver by controlling the rate of data transmission. Methods include:

1. StopandWait: Sender transmits one frame and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next.
2. Sliding Window: Allows multiple frames to be sent before needing acknowledgments, using a window size to manage flow.
3. CreditBased Control: Allocates transmission credits based on receiver capacity, allowing senders to transmit accordingly.



Question 32:

Description: Compare between datagram and virtual circuit?

Answer:
 Datagram:
   Connectionless: Each packet is treated independently with no predefined path.
   Routing Flexibility: Each packet can take a different path to the destination.
   No Guaranteed Delivery: Packets may be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of order.
  
 Virtual Circuit:
   ConnectionOriented: Establishes a fixed path before data transmission.
   Consistent Routing: All packets follow the same path.
   Guaranteed Delivery: Provides reliable and ordered delivery through mechanisms like acknowledgments and retransmissions.



Question 33:

Description: What is TCP slow start approach explain it in brief.

Answer:
TCP Slow Start is a congestion control mechanism that begins data transmission with a low congestion window size, typically one segment. For each acknowledgment received, the congestion window increases exponentially, doubling each roundtrip time. This allows TCP to quickly discover the network's capacity while avoiding congestion. If packet loss is detected, Slow Start is reset to reduce the congestion window.



Question 34:

Description: What is the difference between the adaptive and nonadaptive routing algorithms.

Answer:
 Adaptive Routing Algorithms:
   Dynamic: Adjust routes based on current network conditions like traffic load or link failures.
   Responsive: Can respond to changes in realtime, optimizing path selection.
  
 NonAdaptive Routing Algorithms:
   Static: Use fixed routes that do not change in response to network conditions.
   Predictable: Simpler to implement but less efficient in handling varying network states.



Question 35:

Description: Explain the shortest path routing algorithm.

Answer:
(Repeated Question 19.)

Answer:
The shortest path routing algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, determines the most efficient path from a source to all other nodes in a network by evaluating the total cost (e.g., distance, time) of various routes. It iteratively selects the closest unvisited node, updates path costs to its neighbors, and continues until the shortest paths to all nodes are established, ensuring optimal routing for data transmission.



Question 36:

Description: Explain the services that are provided by the network layer.

Answer:
(Repeated Question 20.)

Answer:
The Network Layer offers services including:

1. Routing: Selecting optimal paths for data packets across interconnected networks.
2. Logical Addressing: Assigning unique IP addresses to devices for identification and location.
3. Packet Forwarding: Moving packets from source to destination through intermediate routers.
4. Fragmentation and Reassembly: Dividing large packets into smaller fragments for transmission and reconstructing them at the destination.
5. Error Handling and Diagnostics: Detecting network errors and providing tools like ICMP for troubleshooting.



Question 37:

Description: Explain Flooding routing algorithm.

Answer:
The Flooding routing algorithm sends incoming packets through every outgoing link except the one it arrived on, ensuring that all possible paths are utilized. While it guarantees delivery if a path exists, it is highly redundant and can lead to excessive network traffic and potential routing loops. To mitigate this, mechanisms like sequence numbers and TTL (Time to Live) are used to limit packet propagation.



Question 38:

Description: Explain the Distance Vector Routing algorithm.

Answer:
Distance Vector Routing algorithms, such as the BellmanFord algorithm, determine the best path to each destination based on distance metrics (e.g., hop count). Each router maintains a table of distances to other nodes and shares this information with neighboring routers periodically. Routers update their tables based on received information, converging on the shortest paths. This approach is simple but can be susceptible to issues like routing loops and slow convergence.



Question 39:

Description: What is the countâ€“toâ€“infinity problem?

Answer:
The counttoinfinity problem occurs in Distance Vector Routing when routers continuously increment their distance metrics for a failed route without a clear termination point. This leads to routing loops and delayed convergence, as routers keep updating their tables in an attempt to find a valid path. Techniques like split horizon, route poisoning, and holddown timers are implemented to mitigate this issue.



Question 40:

Description: Explain link state routing algorithm.

Answer:
Link State Routing algorithms, such as OSPF, require each router to have a complete map of the network's topology. Routers exchange information about their immediate connections (link states) with all other routers, allowing each to independently calculate the shortest path to every destination using algorithms like Dijkstra's. This results in faster convergence and greater scalability compared to Distance Vector Routing.



Question 41:

Description: Explain the Hierarchical Routing algorithm.

Answer:
Hierarchical Routing organizes the network into multiple levels or regions, reducing routing complexity and improving scalability. At higher levels, aggregate routes are used between regions, while at lower levels, more detailed routes are maintained within regions. This division minimizes the size of routing tables and limits the scope of route advertisements, enhancing efficiency and manageability in large networks.



Question 42:

Description: Explain Broadcast Routing and Multicast Routing.

Answer:
 Broadcast Routing: Involves sending data packets to all nodes in a network. It is commonly used in local area networks (LANs) for purposes like address resolution or network announcements.
  
 Multicast Routing: Targets a specific group of destination nodes, allowing data transmission to multiple recipients efficiently. It is used for applications like streaming media, conferences, and realtime data distribution, reducing unnecessary traffic compared to broadcasting.
